# Worker Payment Automation for Highridge Construction Company

This project provides Python and R scripts to automate weekly salary processing and payment slip generation for 400 construction workers. The system dynamically assigns employee levels based on salary and gender conditions and generates individual payment slips in plain text.

  - **A5-F**: Female workers with salary > $7,500 and < $30,000
- Generates a text-based payment slip for each worker.
